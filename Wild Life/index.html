				<h1>About Us and What We Do</h1>
				<p>
					Dolphins, majestic, fascinating, smart, and more complex than we ever imagined, these are things we all know, but I bet there's lots you don't know
					and that's what we're here for! Dolphins have lots of interesting facts and lots of questionable facts, the kind I cannot talk about
					if I want to keep this family friendly. They are a very specific class of whales, as you will see in some of their names, and have lots in common but their are some clear distinctions 
					between most dolphins and whales, and trust me it's certainly not just their sizing.
				</p>
				<p>
					They are amazing creature, but unfortunately many of them have become endangered due to human involvement and they could use your help, and we could use your money! To get involved and to help them of course! Like all wild life sites really do,
					never pocketing a single cent, right? So down below you will find a section to donate something back, and we promise it will go a long way!

			<h1>Different Species</h1>

				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/Hectors.jpg" alt="Hector's Dolphin">
					<h3>Hector's Dolphin</h3>
					<p>Hector's Dolphin, is the only cetacean native to New Zealand and was named after Sir James Hector. They are also one of the smallest dolphin species with adults usually averaging only 1.4 m in length.
						Unfortunately for these little guys along with their sub-species, the Maui's, they live close to shore and have a big problem with getting caught in recreational and commercial gill and trawl nets. This along with other threats have brough their population
						down to under 7,000 which is still better than the Maui's whose population has dwindled to under 55 remaining.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/Irrawaddy.jpg" alt="Irrawaddy Dolphin">
					<h3>Irrawaddy Dolphin</h3>
					<p>These little guys are found in small groups throughout parts of southeast Asia where salt water and freshwater mix and are on the verge of extinction with an estimated population under 100.
						They are also close relatives of the ocra whale whose population is a lot less threatened. The main cause of the declining population is due to hunting and pollution in the water.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/AmazonRiverDolphin.jpg" alt="Amazon River Dolphin">
					<h3>Amazon River Dolphin</h3>
					<p>The amazon river dolphin, also known as the pink river dolphin as their colour shift as they grow to adulthood, are the largest species of river dolphins with adults reaching up to 2.5 m in length.
						As with all toothed whales, the Amazon River Dolphin have a distinct "mellon" on their head which they use for bio-sonar, at least that's the theorized usage.
						Unfortunately like many creatures they are endangered due to humans polluting the rivers. Yay, us!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/Orca (2).jpg" alt="Orca (Killer Whale)">
					<h3>Orca aka. Killer Whale</h3>
					<p>Orcas, also known as killer whales due to a miss translation, are ferocious and effective hunters. They frequently go after whales hence the name and are even know to keep the great whites out of our water (they really like shark liver).
						That being said, humans need not fear them too heavily as they rarely attack humans in nature, only in aquariums due to that being a terrible place for them to live. Again, yay us!
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/Short-FinnedPilotWhale.jpg" alt="Short-Finned Pilot Whale">
					<h3>Short-Finned Pilot Whale</h3>
					<p>These short finned mammals are found in populations globally with an estimated total over 700,000, but they are noticing that their populations have been migrating further north due to global warming.
						They range in size from 3-6 m in length and, like orcas, have a matrilineal social hierarchy and is polygamous, with a common ratio of 8 females per male.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxes-1-6">
					<img src="images/Fitted/Bottlenose.jpg" alt="Bottlenose Dolphin">
					<h3>Bottlenose Dolphin</h3>
					<p>Ah, the classic, probably what everyone thinks of when they hear the word "dolphin" and for good reason, they are common in aquariums!
						No, there are lots of reason they are well-known, first off there's lots of them, secondly they are very smart and sociable, and of course they are adorable and very entertaining!
						 Just don't go looking into what they get up to on their spare time.
